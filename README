GNU LibreJS --an add-on for GNU IceCat and Mozilla Firefox-- detects and
blocks nonfree nontrivial JavaScript while allowing its execution on
pages containing code that is either trivial and/or free.


Notes on working with the code
-------------------------------
## Running the addon ##
Download jpm, then do something like this in the LibreJS
directory:

    jpm run -b `which abrowser`

## Debugging ##
Uncomment lines 22 and 23 in lib/main.js to enable printing of
console.debug() statements.

## Adding new whitelisted libraries ##
* Edit data/script_libraries/script-libraries.json by using
data/script_libraries/getHash.sh

## Releasing a new version ##
* Update version number in:
** configure.ac
** package.json
** doc/version.texi
** data/display_panel/content/display-panel.html
* Then run `make info` to build the docs with gendocs.sh
* `git commit` and `git tag 6.0.4`
* Export a tarball:
    git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=librejs-6.0.4/ 6.0.4 >librejs-6.0.4.tar.gz
    mv librejs-6.0.4.tar.gz ~/releases/librejs/6.0.4/
* Make xpi file: jpm xpi
* Upload this xpi file to AMO.
* In package.json, change "name" to "librejs-prerelease", and remove
  the "id" attribute (so AMO doesn't recognize this as the listed
  add-on when we make our own signed xpi file for self-distribution).
* Run the `jpm sign --api-key KEY --api-secret SECRET` command. You can
  get the key and secret strings here:
  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/
  This will create a signed xpi and upload it to AMO as an "unlisted"
  extension. Then you'll find a gnu_librejs-x.x.x-fx.xpi file in the
  current directory. Upload this file to the gnu servers -- FF 43+
  will allow it to be installed.
* Upload to gnu servers, update gnu.org/s/librejs links
* Make announcement on info-gnu and savannah.gnu.org
* Update #librejs topic
